## We practice KumbayOps&#8480;

IT operations and development not getting along? A movement called _DevOps_ aims to help organizations like yours bridge the gap, but its focus on rapid iteration and self-service enablement may expose you to unnecessary risk if security isn't baked into the process from the start.

With more than a decade of experience in providing DevOps and security solutions to enterprises large and small, we founded KumbayOps LLC to address a need in the small- and medium-sized business community: putting the **yes** back into security using our KumbayOps&#8480; method. We channel a holistic understanding of **DevSecOps**, which applies security concerns to DevOps, into consulting, training, advisory, and audit services to bring safety, stability, and speed to the center of your universe.
